### Hacking MRI

MRI: Matz Ruby Interpreter, the canonical implementation of the [Ruby
Programming Language](https://www.ruby-lang.org)

* [[building-ruby]] - Get the source and configure your build environment

* [[setting-up-vscode-for-mri]] - Configure VSCode for editing, building and
  debugging Ruby

* [[running-tests]] - Run the MRI tests

* [[debugging]] - Run the Debugger, set breakpoints and trace paths through the
  interpreter:

* [[debugging-ruby-gc]] - Use specific debugging techniques to inspect the Garbage
  collector:

* [[ruby-object-lifecycle]] - Understand how Ruby manages memory

* [[useful-macros]] - Know about the most useful preprocessor macros

* [[working-with-core-dumps]] - Work with Core dumps (useful when stepping through
  the debugger isn't practical)

* [[profiling]] - Using GPerftools to generate CPU execution stats

* [[ruby-hacking-guide-notes]] - My notes from reading the [translated Ruby
  Hacking Guide](https://ruby-hacking-guide.github.io/minimum.html)

### C development

* [[lldb-tips]] - A brief cheatsheet for how to use the LLDB Debugger

### Other stuff

* [[vim-tags-and-navigation]] - Navigating a codebase in Vim
* [[vim-buffer-management]] - How I edit multiple files in vim (without tabs
  because I hate the UI)
