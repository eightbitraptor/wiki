# eightbitraptor[wiki]

## What is this?

This is a wiki. It's my knowledge management system - a place to write down the
notes and scraps of information that I need to keep while working on new things.
It's built and published using [Foam, an open source knowledge management system
built on VSCode](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/).

> This wiki is alive, only minimally curated and updated frequently. There will
> be typos, mistakes, and areas that are incomplete.

## Who am I

[My name is Matt](https://www.eightbitraptor.com/about). I go by
[eightbitraptor](https://www.eightbitraptor.com) almost everywhere on the
internet. You can read more about me, and also longer articles that I write [on
my primary site/blog](https://www.eightbitraptor.com).
