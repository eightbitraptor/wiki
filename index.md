### Hacking MRI

MRI: Matz Ruby Interpreter, the canonical implementation of the [Ruby
Programming Language](https://www.ruby-lang.org)

* Get the source and configure your build environment: [[building-ruby]]
* Configure VSCode for editing, building and debugging Ruby:
  [[setting-up-vscode-for-mri]]
* Run the MRI tests [[running-tests]]
* Run the Debugger, set breakpoints and trace paths through the interpreter:
  [[debugging]]
* Use specific debugging techniques to inspect the Garbage collector:
  [[debugging-ruby-gc]]
* Understand how Ruby manages memory: [[ruby-object-lifecycle]]
* Know about the most useful preprocessor macros: [[useful-macros]]
* Work with Core dumps (useful when stepping through the debugger isn't
  practical): [[working-with-core-dumps]]

### C development

* A brief cheatsheet for how to use the LLDB Debugger: [[lldb_tips]]

### Other stuff

* Navigating a codebase in Vim [[vim-tags-and-navigation]]
