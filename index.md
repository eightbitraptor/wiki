# eightbitraptor[wiki]

## What is this?

This is a wiki. It's my knowledge management system - a place to write down the
notes and scraps of information that I need to keep while working on new things.
It's built and published using [Foam, an open source knowledge management system
built on VSCode](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/).

> This wiki is alive, only minimally curated and updated frequently. There will
> be typos, mistakes, and areas that are incomplete.

## Who am I

[My name is Matt](https://www.eightbitraptor.com/about). I go by
[eightbitraptor](https://www.eightbitraptor.com) almost everywhere on the
internet. You can read more about me, and also longer articles that I write [on
my primary site/blog](https://www.eightbitraptor.com).

### Dev Notes
* [[C-development]] - Things I've learned about writing C, as well as workflows
  and tooling that help me write and debug code in reasonably large codebases.
* [[CRuby-development]] - Notes on the structure and implementaton of Matz Ruby
  Interpreter, the canonical implementation of the [Ruby programming
  language](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
* [[Allocation-tracking]] - Some ways to track memory allocations
* [[MMTk]] - Notes about the Memory Management Toolkit and it's Ruby binding
  (these are very raw and probably not useful)
* [[garbage-collection]] - A hub for notes about GC in a more general sense. Ruby specific GC stuff is likely in [[cruby-development]].
* [[glossary]] - I run into terms all the time that I don't know what they mean.
  Here's where I'm going to collect a few of them and try and keep track.

### Other tech stuff
* [[vim-tags-and-navigation]] - Navigating a codebase in Vim
* [[vim-buffer-management]] - How I edit multiple files in vim (without tabs
  because I hate the UI)
* [[Mathematical-notation]] - I always get stuck with notation, here's a
  glossary of stuff I've run into

### Language learning
* [[japanese]]

### Books

* [[The-Garbage-Collection-Handbook]] - The art of automatic memory management
  (Richard Jones, Antony Hosking, Eliot Moss)
* [[Types-and-Programming-Languages]] (Benjamin C. Pearce)
