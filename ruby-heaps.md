# Ruby Heaps

There are two heaps. the `eden` heap and the `tomb` heap. Each heap consists of
`pages` (see [[ruby-heap-pages]]) each page holds [[rvalue]] objects.

Ruby allocates objects on the eden heap, until that heap is full. When GC cleans
up all the objects on a heap page, that page gets moved to the tomb heap. When
Ruby runs out of pages on the eden heap it will check to see if there are any
pages on the tomb heap that can be resurrected before asking the operating
system to `malloc` enough memory for another page to extend the eden heap (TODO:
More detail here about tomb heaps)

* `rb_heap_t` a struct to hold pages of `RVALUE` objects
  * `free_pages` - this is a pointer to a `heap_page`
  * `using_page` - this is also a pointer to a `heap_page`
  * `pages` - this is a `list_head`. Not sure what that is or what this is for
  * `sweeping_page` - this is a pointer to a `heap_page`, the inline comment
    tells me that it's an "iterator for .pages", not sure what this means yet.
  * `total_pages` - ?
  * `total_slots` - ? (how many slots fit in a page)
  * So where do these get initialised?
