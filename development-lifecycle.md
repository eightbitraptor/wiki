# Development Lifecycle

## Running tests

There are a bunch of ways to verify your changes to Ruby after you've build the
binary. Which one you'll use will depend on where you're working in the
codebase, and how quickly you need feedback.

From fastest (least coverage) to slowest (most coverage), these are:

- `make btest` requires `miniruby`. ~1400 tests, ~50 seconds on my mac.
- `make test` requires full `ruby` and runs a test suite. ~1400 tests, ~60
  seconds on my Macbook.
- `make test-all` requires full `ruby`, 20k tests, ~20 minutes.

## Running specific tests

You can run a single test file with

```
make test-all TESTS=/path/to/test/file.rb
```

## Running a specific test and attaching `lldb`

```
make test-all TESTS='test/ruby/test_gc_compact.rb -n test_complex_hash_keys' RUNRUBYOPT=--debugger=lldb
```

Then when you get the `lldb` prompt type `process launch` to start debugging

## Running arbitrary scripts

Useful for running small changes that you want to run with your miniruby or
whatever, without having to write an actual test. This is also tied into the
debuggers and stuff see ([[gc_debug]]).

Make sure that a `test.rb` file exists inside your `ruby` checkout directory

- `make runruby` runs `test.rb` with your compiled `miniruby`
