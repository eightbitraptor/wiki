## Particles

Particles are the connecting words, that usually indicate the relationship
between a noun and a verb. There are loads. Here are the ones I've learned so
far and some example sentances.

* は - Pronounced "wa", this is the wa in わたしはマットです。My teacher refers to this
as the "topic maker" as it indicates the main focus of the sentance.
* が - This is used the same as は but puts more emphasis on the noun before it rather than what's after it.
  * わたしはマットです。 - I am Matt.
  * わたしがマットです。 - **I** am Matt (think spider-man pointing meme).
* の - This is a possessive particle. It indicates that the thing after "belongs
  to" the thing before. eq. これはわたしのくるまでそ。
