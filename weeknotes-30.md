# Weeknotes 30

- My monitor went bang last week, so I've been working on my laptop screen
  propped up on a pile of books. Work arranged for me to have a new monitor
  which arrived on Tuesday. They sent me an upgrade - it's a couple of inches
  bigger than my old screen and 4k rather than 2k. It's absolutely lovely,
  probably partly due to how grateful my eyes are to not be peering over my desk
  at a laptop screen any more.

  First world problems though. The bezel on modern monitors is so small there's
  nowhere to put a webcam without obscuring some part of the screen! 
  
  I know, cry me a river.

- I bought a new pot for brewing beer in. After much hand wringing I finally settled on the cheap and cheerful option which was a 20L stainless steel stock pot from eBay. It cost all of Â£30 and is so thin that the base pops and bends when there's a decent amount of liquid in it.

  That being said it does the job admirably, the handles are riveted on
  well which is important when you're moving around large quantities of boiling
  sugar water.

- I brewed my first batch in the new pot on Tuesday night and all went very
  well. I'm able to do full wort boils for the batch sizes I brew now and that
  makes the whole process much easier.

  Now I have 7L of an American IPA in the fermenter, hopped to about 70 IBU's
  with Chinook. Gravity was 1.061 so I'm hoping for an abv of about 6.4%.

  I hit all my expected gravity numbers this time around, which isn't that much
  of an acheivement considering it's an extract brew, but it at least means I'm
  building an understanding of boil off rates on my system, so I'm pleased.

  And I also set fire to a tea towel. Don't ask.

- I've been using [Foam](foambubble.github.com) at work to try and document all the new stuff I'm learning about developing on MRI.
